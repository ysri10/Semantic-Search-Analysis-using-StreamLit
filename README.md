# Semantic Search Application

## Overview

This is a **Semantic Search Application** that allows users to upload multiple PDF or TXT files, process their contents, and perform a search across these files to find the most relevant results based on a query. The application uses **Flask** for the backend (handling file uploads, text processing, and searching) and **React** for the frontend (managing file uploads, displaying results, and handling user queries). It uses **FAISS** for fast nearest-neighbor search and **DistilBERT** for sentence embeddings.

### Architecture

1. **Frontend (React):**
   - Users can upload multiple files, search across those files, and see the results.
   - It communicates with the backend via REST API.
   
2. **Backend (Flask):**
   - Handles file uploads, extracts text from PDFs or TXT files, and processes it using the DistilBERT model.
   - FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is used to create a vector index of text chunks for efficient semantic search.

### Tools & Libraries

- **React**: Frontend library to build the user interface.
- **Flask**: Backend framework to handle requests and serve APIs.
- **FAISS**: Library for efficient similarity search over embeddings.
- **PyTorch**: For loading the DistilBERT model and generating embeddings.
- **Transformers**: Hugging Face library to work with transformer models.
- **PyPDF2**: For extracting text from PDF files.
- **axios**: For handling HTTP requests from React to Flask.
- **Werkzeug**: Utility for file handling in Flask.
- **psutil**: For logging system memory usage during processing.
- **Flask-CORS**: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for the API.
  
### Assumptions
- The user will upload either PDF or TXT files for search.
- Text from the uploaded files will be processed into smaller chunks to make it searchable.
- The FAISS index is built using sentence embeddings generated by DistilBERT.
- The application is designed to run locally and can be easily extended to run on a server.

## Project Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (for running the React frontend)
- **Python 3.8+** (for the Flask backend)
- **pip** (for installing Python packages)
- **virtualenv** (recommended for managing Python dependencies)

### Backend (Flask API) Setup

1. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Flask server:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   flask run --port=5001
   ```

4. **Backend running on**: `http://localhost:5001`

   The backend exposes two routes:
   - **/upload (POST)**: For uploading files.
   - **/search (POST)**: For querying the uploaded files.

### Frontend (React) Setup

1. **Install Node.js dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the React development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Frontend running on**: `http://localhost:3000`

### Running the Application

1. **Upload Files:**
   - Visit `http://localhost:3000`.
   - Use the file upload feature to upload multiple PDF or TXT files.

2. **Search:**
   - After uploading files, enter a query in the search box to perform a semantic search.
   - The results will display the most relevant chunks from the uploaded files.

## Conclusion

This application demonstrates a practical implementation of a semantic search tool leveraging modern machine learning models for natural language understanding and search efficiency using FAISS. By following the setup instructions, you should be able to run this project locally and extend it for further use cases like deploying on cloud servers or adding more advanced search functionalities.
